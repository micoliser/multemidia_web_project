Any idea yet why he's
come down to D.C.?

8

00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:55,391
Hey.

00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,660
Um, is your mom home?

26
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:00,196
Uh, yeah, but she told me

27
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:01,497
I wasn't supposed to talk

28
00:01:01,498 --> 00:01:03,499
to you... or your friends.

29
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:07,437
Molly, inside, now.

30
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:12,475
What are you doing here?

31
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:13,943
We came to talk.

32
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:17,213
Is Crane here? He said he'd meet me.

33
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:18,247
No, he's not here.

34
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:19,951
I told the two of you
to stay away from us.

35
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:20,850
Look, I know this is

36
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,318
a lot for you to handle,

37
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,153
finding out that Molly
is the next Witness.

38
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:27,223
I have lived through what that's like,

39
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:28,691
that's why you have to listen to us.

40
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:29,959
The only thing I have to do

41
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,127
is protect my daughter.

42
00:01:31,128 --> 00:01:32,362
I know, of course,

43
00:01:32,363 --> 00:01:34,230
and all I'm trying to say

44
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:35,798
is...

45
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:38,801
Damn it, where is Crane?

46
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:40,185
He said we would do this together.

47
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:41,371
Well, when you find him,

48
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:43,940
you can both not come here again.

49
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:49,412
That went well.

</font> <i>Mr. Dreyfuss,</i>

51
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:55,554
<i>how was your visit with Dr. Lonergan?</i>

52
00:01:55,555 --> 00:01:57,387
Dr. Lonergan said

53
00:01:57,388 --> 00:02:01,057
my current life expectancy is 85 years.

54
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:02,925
Eighty-five?

55
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:04,560
Enough for most.

56
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:06,295
When I'm 85,

57
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:08,364
I'm just gonna be getting started.

58
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:10,266
Think about what
I've accomplished so far

59
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:12,802
and then think about how much
more I could do.

60
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:14,637
It's not that I need to have more time,

61
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:17,206
it's that the world
needs me to have more time.

62
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,741
This is for their benefit.

63
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:20,543
Of course...

64
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,844
and it has nothing to do

65
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:23,508
with what will happen
to your eternal soul

66
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:24,313
upon your death.

67
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:27,016
My friend...

68
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:29,018
...I'm afraid you

69
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:30,386
think too small.

70
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:32,021
Once again, thank you.

71
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:35,191
I encourage you
to think globally, but act

72
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:36,626
narrowly.

73
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:38,528
Case in point, where are we

74
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:39,762
with the next talisman? Hmm?

75
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:41,697
Still tracking it, but in the meantime,

76
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:43,241
I've located the map of the ley lines,

77
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:45,234
the wellsprings where
their power converges.

78
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:47,303
It's arriving at a museum tonight.

79
00:02:47,304 --> 00:02:48,438
Wunderbar.

80
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,906
At last,

81
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:51,574
finally get to know
where we can assemble

82
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:54,310
all these lovely puzzle pieces.

<i>Hello?</i>

85
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:04,153
Crane?

86
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:06,756
You left me hanging with Diana.

87
00:03:06,757 --> 00:03:09,325
How many times have I told
you to get a decent dead bolt?

88
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:10,789
A five-year-old could break in here.

89
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,924
Crane?

90
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:16,465
Oh.

91
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:20,036
Ugh.

92
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:22,071
Crane?

93
00:03:35,486 --> 00:03:37,587
Oh.

94
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,433
According to the spectrometer,

95
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:52,034
it's ten percent unknown protein

96
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:54,704
and 90% ferric hydroxide.

97
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:56,205
That's spider silk.

98
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:58,007
Spider silk?

99
00:03:58,008 --> 00:03:59,842
That was all over Crane's apartment.

100
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:01,177
Well, that's a big-ass spider.

101
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:02,545
- It can't be good.
- Okay, well,

102
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:04,780
Diana can probably
put out an APB on Crane.

103
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:07,981
You know, maybe he just went
to the mall and got lost... again.

104
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,553
No, he's not answering any
of his calls or texts.

105
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,299
Okay, well, maybe she
can put out a trace...

106
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,523
No, we don't need to call her.

107
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:15,224
Besides,

108
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:18,094
wherever Crane is now,
a cop is not gonna help.

109
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:20,429
The last time I saw him
he was coming out of J Street.

110
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,133
Dreyfuss said they used to
trap monsters there and...

111
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:27,036
it's possible we brought
something else back with us.

112
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:28,304
Something evil.

113
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:29,839
- Or something that took Crane?
- Yes.

114
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,941
Something that doesn't like light.

115
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:37,179
Whatever made this probably
goes real heavy on the SPF.

116
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,848
Wait, hang on.

117
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:41,183
Oh, yes, yes, uh, I read something

118
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:43,753
in Benjamin Franklin's journals.

119
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:45,321
Uh... here.

120
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:47,023
In 1778,

121
00:04:47,024 --> 00:04:49,025
Franklin wrote about coming across

122
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:50,860
"a curious substance.

123
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:52,929
"A, uh, viscous secretion

124
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,353
"displaying otherworldly properties

00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:56,165
and marked photophobia."

126
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,709
Where did Franklin find the substance?

127
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,802
Uh, he found it from
some colonists in Maryland.

128
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:02,572
Apparently a farmer
from Williamsburg went missing.

129
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:04,974
Uh, they discovered his body
a week later in a cave

130
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:06,676
in the Aberdeen Woods.

131
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:08,457
I mean, it had been
cocooned in this stuff.

132

It's the Aberdeen Proving Ground.

138
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:26,629
Wait, you think
the cave is still out there?

139
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,297
Only one way to find out.

140
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:29,832
Um, Aberdeen is an army facility

141
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,701
with army men carrying army guns.

142
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:33,669
And it's standing between
me and that cave.

143
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,071
Noted.

144
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:36,906

- We will?

145

</font> Yes, if you're going

147
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:42,345
But this is a little
out of your league.

148
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:44,613
It's easier if I go alone.

149
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:47,752
She thinks we can't handle it.

150
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:49,952
You think that we can handle
five to ten

151
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:52,722
- for trespassing on a military base?
- Okay, Alex,

152
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:55,291
we helped take down
a Horseman of the Apocalypse.

153
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:56,726
Okay, our days of just sitting here

154
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:57,910
and watching this world go by

155
00:05:57,911 --> 00:05:59,729

157
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:03,232
Really? Alex,

158
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,134
the Catholics who founded Maryland

159
00:06:05,135 --> 00:06:06,902
thought that this cave was home

160
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:09,639
to the Sicarius Spei.
The slayer of hope.

161
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,974
All right, this thing is the living

162
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:15,478
embodiment of despair, and it
doesn't just kill its victims.

163
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,746
No, it...

164
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:18,781
it-it feeds on their misery

165
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:21,217
until it drives them
to kill themselves.

166
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:22,985
You think she's ready for that?

00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:53,682
Where am I?

171
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:03,025
What in God's name is this?

172
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:04,427
Order!

The jurors of our sovereign lord

175
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,135
present that you did commit
certain crimes of cowardice,

176
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:14,770
thoughtlessness,

177
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:18,174
and abdication of your sacred
duties as a Witness.

178
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:19,508
You stand charged

179
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,944
with the sundry act of murder.

180
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,815
Murder?

181
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:27,249
Whose murder?

182
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,351
Who is making this accusation?

183
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:41,997
No.

184
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:43,532
It can't be.

185
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,402
Hello, Father.

186
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,208
<font color="#ff0000">♪</font>

187
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:29,310
This is not real.

188
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,505
This is some kind of nightmare or...

189
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:33,231
a vision, or...

190
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:35,691
Is this a dead girl
which I see before me?

191
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:38,961
But I was in my rooms, and then, um...

192
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:40,262
I assure you

193
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:42,531
I am as real

194
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:45,267
as the guilt in your heaving heart.

195
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:47,169
- No, you are not my son.
- Mm, oh.

196
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,537
Henry died.

197
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:50,973
You have seen enough spirits come back

198
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:53,709
from beyond the veil, Father.

199
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,445
Look at me.

200
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:57,680
Am I not

201
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,782
the baby you abandoned?

202
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,319
Am I not the child

203
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,054
you left to be persecuted?

204
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:13,162
Am I not the man you snuffed out

205
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:15,130
like a simpering dog?

206
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:22,538
If this truly is you,

207
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:25,174
Henry,

208
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:26,809
then I too am dead,

209
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,045
and this is a kind of limbo

210
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:33,148
where I await eternal judgment.

211
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:36,652
If that makes you feel better.

212
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:40,389
Now, if you'll excuse me,

213
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,526
I have an opening statement to make...

214
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:47,163
to prove Ichabod Crane
is guilty of the murder

215
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:50,366
of Abigail Mills.

Ah.

219
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:23,098
Pete, is that you? Quit fooling around.

220
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:25,122
This is a restricted area.
What are you doing here?

221
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:27,336
Oh, wait, you're not Pete.

222
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:28,237
Put the bag down.

223
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:29,505
- What?
- Bag down.

224
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:30,739
Oh, okay, uh...

225
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,107
- Hands up.
- Okay.

226
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:33,776
Uh, I thought you were my boyfriend.

227
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:35,911
I-I'm sorry, we were just
trying to find our way

228
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:38,113
off the trails and he went up ahead.

229
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:40,215
Is he okay? Where is he?

230
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:43,285
This is an army facility.

231
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:45,109
- What?
- Didn't you see the signs walking in?

232
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,957
No, no, I didn't see anything.
I'm so sorry.

233
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,358
Am I in trouble?

234
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:54,430
Come on, I'll get you out of here.

235
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:55,965
- I can get that.
- I got it.

236
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:57,266
Whoa, whoa,

237
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:59,268
hey, what is that?

238
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:01,237
- Hands back up! Hands up!
- Yeah.

239
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:02,972
Cover her.

240
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:04,673
Hands behind your back.

241
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:09,945
</font> That is so not good.

242
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:11,413
We got to help her.

243
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:13,182
How?

244
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:16,118
See if they'll trade her for
some free archiving work?

245
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:18,754
I have an idea.

246
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:19,855
Ladies...

247
00:11:21,324 --> 00:11:23,092
...gentlemen,

248
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:24,960
friends,

249
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:29,431
we are not here for mere vengeance,

250
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:31,967
petty victories.

251
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:33,235
We are here

252
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:35,838
for justice

253
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,239
for one who greatly deserves it:

254
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:41,910
Grace Abigail Mills.

255
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,746
She was a warrior,

256
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:44,913
a champion,

257
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:46,749
and her life was cut short

258
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,684
by the senseless actions

259
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,352

This is insanity.

00:11:54,324 --> 00:11:55,824
The Lieutenant died so that

263
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:57,326
all of us may live.

264
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:59,128
She sacrificed herself for you.

265
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:00,663
Because there was no other way

266
00:12:00,664 --> 00:12:02,231
to stop the apocalypse.

267
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:04,466
No other way? Ha!

268
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:07,536
That's your excuse
for everything, isn't it?

269
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:09,371
There was no other way

270
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:13,309
to save the life of Joe Corbin, either.

271
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,577
Or Abraham Van Brunt

272
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:17,913
or my mother.

Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow

276
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:25,287
this man...

277
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:27,656
to bear another child,

278
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:29,358
to love another wife,

279
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,160
to make another friend.

280
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:32,728
We cannot allow

281
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:36,198
Ichabod Crane to live another day.

282
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:40,169
'Cause everyone he touches,

283
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,638
sooner or later, dies.

284
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,891
Is it dinner time yet?

285
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:04,460
I'm starving.

286
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:07,363
- All I have are Tic Tacs.
- What are you doing here?

287
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:08,797
<font color="#ffff80">I'm saving your ass.

288
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:10,099
You're welcome, by the way.

289
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,567

293
00:13:16,873 --> 00:13:18,296
Need you to sign right here, ma'am.

00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,965
</font> Thank you.

295
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:22,911
And how did you know I was here?

296
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:24,380
Jake and Alex called,

297
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:25,814
said you were in trouble.

298
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,280
You know, it's nothing
I couldn't have handled.

299
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:31,548
Next pee break, I was gone.

300
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:35,023
So, why don't you
save the "you're welcomes"

301
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:36,458
for someone who needs 'em.

302
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,613
</font> I've entered the coordinates

303
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:43,799
of this cave of yours into my GPS.

304
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,735
I thought you didn't want to
have anything to do with us.

305
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:48,637
Well, I don't want you
anywhere near Molly.

306
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:52,107
I don't trust you,
not after all the lies.

307
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:54,109
But Jake called
and said it was an emergency,

308
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,111
that Crane could be hurt or worse.

309
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:58,247
And you just had to come help?

310
00:13:58,248 --> 00:13:59,711
You know, it may come as a surprise,

311
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:01,135
but Crane and I got along just fine

312
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:02,551
for a long time without you.

313
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:04,953
I know all about how you got along.

314
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:07,790
Single mom, deadbeat dad,

315
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,492
in and out of foster care
before bouncing between juvy

316
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:12,728
and psych institutions.

317
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:16,698
Your file made for an interesting read.

318
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,571
So my file,

319
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:25,407
did it say anything about why
I was in the psych institutions?

320
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:30,546
Abby and I ran into something
when we were Molly's age.

321
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:33,882
Something supernatural and it
messed us up for a long time.

322
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:35,417
Only later did we find out

323
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:38,153
that it all happened
because Abby was the Witness.

324
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:41,690
Hey,

325
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:43,425
you can try and deny what's happening.

326
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,627
That's what my sister did.

327
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:47,763
But it caught up to her
and sooner or later,

328
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:49,097
it's gonna catch up to you.

329
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,399
And Molly, too.

330
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,470
Something was dragged down here.

331
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:20,762
<font color="#ff0000">♪</font>

332
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,075
Spider silk.

333
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,145
I hate spiders.

334
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:45,621
Crane!

335
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:49,658
</font> Oh, God. What is this?

336
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:50,826
It's a cocoon.

337
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:53,328
- A cocoon?
- Yeah.

338
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:56,298
Ah, it's stuck.

339
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,634
Damn it!

340
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:13,515
Diana, stop!

341
00:16:14,284 --> 00:16:16,351
You're hurting Crane.

342
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:22,791
What's happening to me?

343
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:28,528
- What?
- Crane is bleeding from the same place

344
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,330
as that thing.

345
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:32,432
They must be psychically linked.

346
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:34,601
I don't think we can kill
it or it'll kill him.

347
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,637
Cut him down and let's get out of here.

348
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:37,781
I'm trying! It's too strong.

349
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:40,340
Plus, I don't think
it's normal webbing.

350
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:42,175
I think it's nerves of some kind.

351
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:47,614
Whatever that thing is,
it's gonna come back soon.

352
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,349
- We cannot stay here.
- Wait,

353
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,217
we got to...

354
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,652
</font> Come on!

355
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:54,121
We'll be back, I promise.

356
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,634
I have seen your true face, demon.

357
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,904
This is an illusion.

358
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:17,110
You need me alive.

359
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:21,481
You need me to succumb willingly.

360
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:25,686
Very well.

361
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:28,221
Shall we play this game?

362
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:31,858
You are good, wise,

363
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,760
God-fearing people.

364
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,328
Will you hear me speak

365
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:37,272
or will you simply accept
what this man tells you

366
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,199
with his... frankly, cheap rhetoric

367
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,934
and grandstanding?

368
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,403
I ask you before God,

369
00:17:43,404 --> 00:17:45,872
allow me to defend myself.

370
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:51,778
Let's hear what he has to say!

371
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,246
</font> Let's hear him!

372
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:54,590
<font color="#ffff80">Let's hear it!

373
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:55,282

374
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,383
order,

375
00:17:56,384 --> 00:17:57,617

376
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,219
order in the court!

377
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,011
Your Honor,

378
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,046
may we allow the accused to speak?

379
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,784
He can only make things worse
for himself.

380
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,890
</font> Hey, guys, uh, I think

381
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,392
I found something.

382
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,727
Franklin's journals didn't
have any more reference

383
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,596
to the Despair creature, but

384
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,599
he did reference the account
of a freed slave who

385
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,301
had a run-in with it at Valley Forge.

386
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,902
Now, I located the account,

387
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,138
but it's in some kind
of handwritten code.

388
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,639
That's Grace Dixon.

389
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,008
Yeah, that's right. How'd you know?

390
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,977
She was a key figure
in the battle against evil

391
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,946
during the war and a friend of Crane's.

392
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,248
Abby and I are her direct descendants.

393
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,850
Try an Al-Qalqashand
transposition cipher,

394
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:41,118
keyword: Fredericks.

395
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,286
That was badass.

396
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,322
I can scan this and
make a digital copy.

397
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,323
Oh, cool, sure.

398
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,757
- Here.
- Okay.

399
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,159
Okay, just let me

400
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,328
try and get this straight... so,

401
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,497
Crane worked with Grace Dixon
250 years ago.

402
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:54,932
Then he wakes up in our time

403
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,834
and the first person he met
was your sister,

404
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,937
her great-great-great granddaughter?

405
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,174
That's quite a coincidence.

406
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,910
No, there are no coincidences. This...

407
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,979
this is what we've been
trying to tell you.

408
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,414
All of us, everyone in this fight,

409
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,682
our lives are entwined.

410
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,884
From Grace, toe and Abby,

411
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,587
to Abby and Crane,
it is one great big web.

412
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,957
And now you're telling me that
Molly is entangled in this web?

413
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,928
If that's how you want to
look at it, yes.

414
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,830
The way I see it,

415
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,498
we're a part of each other's lives now.

416
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,502
That means we can help each other.

417
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,804
And I'll be honest, these connections,

418
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,339
we don't understand them that well.

419
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,441
But I do know this:

420
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,646
Abby and Crane had a bond so strong

421
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,014
that they could literally

422
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,750
tug each other back
from different worlds.

423
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,551
They always knew
how to reach each other

424
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:49,520
and how to...

425
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,922
how to pull each other
out of the depths.

426
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:54,659
That is not something to be afraid of.

427
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,460
That's a gift.

428
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,096
</font> Guys,

429
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,297

Valley Forge, one of
the darkest chapters

456
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:11,769
of the American Revolution,

457
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,472
was caused by the thing that has Crane?

458
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,208
So when Washington said,

459
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,210
"These are the times
that try men's souls,"

460
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,544
he was being literal.

461
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,812
I mean, Despair

462
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,707
put a man's soul on trial.

463
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,692
And this is what Crane is going
through right now?

464
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:27,818
Yes.

465
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,253
If we don't free him soon,

466
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,422
not only will Crane die,

467
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,557
but everyone in the vicinity
of that cave...

468
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,595
- Meaning an army base full of people.
- They'll be driven to suicide.

469
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,374
You say that everyone around me dies.

470
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,436
'Tis true.

471
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:50,374
I have suffered great loss in my life.

472
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,043
But is that not the plight
of a soldier?

473
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:55,312
For that is what I am.

474
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:56,714
A soldier,

475
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,083
engaged in the most vital of wars.

476
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:03,687
So too was the Lieutenant.

477
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:06,557
She was my partner.

478
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,392
She...

479
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:12,229
she was my friend.

480
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,832
She knew all too well the risks

481
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,435
of engaging in battle.

482
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:20,304
And I would die a thousand deaths

483
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,807
if it meant she would live
but one more hour.

484
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:30,113
But in the end...

485
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:34,585
...she made a choice.

486
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,521
And what of me, Father?

487
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:42,326
Was I a soldier, too?

488
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,900
Do you recognize this box?

489
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,535
I spent

490
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,071
200 years in it.

491
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,740
Eating dirt.

492
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:59,543
Breathing in my own filth.

493
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,445
Because of you.

494
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:05,482
Because you failed to protect your son.

495
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:07,985
Henry...

496
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,620
I didn't know you existed.

497
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,888
No.

498
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:15,359
Because you were too busy soldiering.

499
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,262
Be honest with yourself...

500
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:21,498
if you had known
that Mother was with child,

501
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:22,933
would anything have changed?

502
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,835
Would you have done
anything differently?

503
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,905
You're right.

504
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,707
The first duty of a parent
is to protect their child.

505
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,444
A...

506
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,547
A friend reminded me
of that only recently.

507
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,021
I will always regret
what happened to you, Henry.

508
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,891
But if you are a demon,

509
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:50,394
you chose the wrong face.

510
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:56,467
For I cherish the opportunity
to speak once more with my son.

511
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,135
To tell him that,

512
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:01,371
in spite of everything between us,

513
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:03,507
I always loved him.

514
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:07,711
I never gave up hope for him.

515
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,516
Every battle I joined,

516
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,219
I did for those I love

517
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,256
and seek to protect.

518
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:23,060
Especially you, Henry.

519
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:30,334
My boy.

520
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,480
I know I said I'd be home
by now, but...

521
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,717
work just... got crazy.

522
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,461
Yeah, that's okay. Can I watch TV?</font>

523
00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:50,988
Not until your homework's done.

524
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,556
And no pizza.

525
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,359
Tell Claire to heat up
the chicken in the fridge.

526
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,660
You got it.

527
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,896
Moo?

528
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,230
I love you.

529
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:02,165
Love you, too.

530
00:25:12,243 --> 00:25:14,278
She's eating pizza.

531
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,946
And watching TV.

532
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,948
Sounds like my kind of girl.

533
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:23,720
She definitely has a mind of her own.

534
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:25,222
I can't blame her.

535
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,558
Well, you know, it's got to be tough

536
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,327
being the child of a single parent.

537
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,729
Especially one who isn't always there.

538
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,832
It's just you two against the world.

539
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,401
Always has been.

540
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,670
She's my anchor.

541
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:43,240
You know, my mom,

542
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:46,944
she... she did everything

543
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,948
to protect Abby and me.

544
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,183
It was just us against the world.

545
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,453
And, uh, she thought
she could do it alone,

546
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:59,590
but she couldn't.

547
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:03,894
Not with what she was fighting.

548
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,097
Okay.

549
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:10,300
Turns out Grace Dixon managed
to turn things around

550
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:12,235
at Valley Forge
with something she called

551
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:14,037
"the fire of joy."

552
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:16,607
Until now, most people thought
that was just a metaphor

553
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,041
for cheering people up, right?

554
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,276
But it turns out

555
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,845
it was a literal fire.

556
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,413
She came up with a flammable compound

557
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:27,017
capable of
incinerating Despair's webbing.

558
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:30,354
"Saltpeter, bitumen, sulphur,
hot pitch."

559
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,689
I can handle this, except for

560
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,458
"resin of quicklime"?

561
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,627
- Do you mind if I... Thanks.
- Yeah.

562
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:43,934
"Resin of quicklime, AKA..."

563
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,970
Damn.

564
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:49,072
- Nitrated hexamine?
- HMX.

565
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:50,974
Yeah, it's a military-grade explosive.

566
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:53,010
I know, a very dangerous,

567
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,778
very illegal military-grade explosive.

568
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,180
- There's no way you're gonna get...
- I can get some.

569
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,651
I know a guy.

570
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,786
I'm not surprised.

571
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,088
Great. Well, now, all we need now is

572
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:08,759
a delivery device to
concentrate and direct the fire.

573
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,161
Fortunately the specs
listed in this text

574
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,985
match an artifact
that I've been able to track

575
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:15,265
to the Smithsonian storage.
We can get it.

576
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:19,269
W-Wait, you have access to
the Smithsonian storage units?

577
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,571
- W...
- Well, if by access

578
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:23,674
you mean do we have a way
to sneak in and take stuff

579
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,941
without people knowing?

580
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:27,811
Then, yeah, we got access.

581
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,179
Let's go.

582
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:32,516
Look, we...

583
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,918
<font color="#ffff80">always put everything back.

584
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,288
Mostly everything.

585
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,590
I don't want to know this.
I don't want to know this.

586
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,628
What?

587
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,697
You are loving this, aren't you?

588
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,361
Sneaking around.
Playing cloak and dagger.

589
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:50,167
You should've heard yourself
back there.

590
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,235
"We just need a delivery device,
and then we can go get it."

591
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:54,037
Oh, hey, we're
fighting a war against evil.

592
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:56,311
Alex, we helped take down
the Horseman of the Apocalypse.

593
00:27:56,312 --> 00:27:57,646
I know, you keep saying that.

594
00:27:57,647 --> 00:27:59,309
Look, and I'm gonna keep saying it.

595
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,478
I mean, when is that ever
not gonna be cool,

596
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,113
huh?

597
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:09,686
Alex, did you know that five weeks ago,

598
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,855
I had an interview at
the Library of Congress?

599
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,324
You were gonna leave the Vault?
Sitting around

600
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:17,027
and reading about
all of these amazing things

601
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,030
just made me realize
I wasn't doing anything

602
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,500
but sitting around and
reading about amazing things.

603
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:27,304
The stuff in the Vault was
great, but none of it was real.

604
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:31,374
And I knew that as long as
I stayed inside of that Vault,

605
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,609
it would never be.

606
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,144
Never.

607
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:40,784
I mean, talk about
a cave of despair, right?

608
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,086
But then Crane comes along,

609
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:45,756
and all of a sudden,

610
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,357
everything is real.

611
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:51,962
Did you ever consider
that maybe some of that stuff

612
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,364
is best left in the pages
of those books?

613
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,934
Maybe.

614
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:00,003
Yeah, but right now,

615
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,072
I'm ready for anything.

616
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,443

00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,004
Goes with him everywhere.

662
00:33:09,005 --> 00:33:11,030
So Dreyfuss really does
have demonic connections.

663
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:11,707
Mm-hmm.

664
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:13,374
That's something we're gonna
have to deal with tomorrow.

665
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,799
Right now, we got other priorities.

666
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,718
- Yes.
- You loaded up?

667
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:16,945
Yeah.

668
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:18,489
The recipe was pretty straightforward.

669
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,682
As far as "fire of joy" recipes go.

670
00:33:20,683 --> 00:33:22,317
Let's go get our man.

671
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:23,819
</font> <i>So tell me, Father,</i>

672
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,053
<i>who is Diana Thomas?</i>

673
00:33:25,054 --> 00:33:27,122
She is a new ally.

674
00:33:27,123 --> 00:33:29,224
- She a soldier, too?
- She is.

675
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:30,992
Would you say you've formed a bond?

676
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:32,527
I would.

677
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:35,564
She is virtuous of spirit,
noble of character.

678
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:38,400
So, so, y-you have moved on already.

679
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:42,537
Less than two months
and you have a new partner.

680
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:46,675
The person that you cared
about with all your heart

681
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:49,711
not cold in the grave
before you left Sleepy Hollow.

682
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:57,786
There was no other way for us.

683
00:33:57,787 --> 00:33:59,788
"No other way."

684
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:02,124
I think we've heard that before, huh?

685
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,259
Tell me something.

686
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,362
Why haven't you grieved Abigail Mills?

687
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:08,630
: I have.

688
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:11,133
So, it was grieving that motivated you

689
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,535
to find a whole new collection

690
00:34:13,536 --> 00:34:15,570
of compatriots, huh?

691
00:34:15,571 --> 00:34:18,140
But he won't have
to wait long to grieve again.

692
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,876
Won't be too long before

693
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:23,845
one of his new <i>partners is killed.</i>

694
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:27,082
Even worse, I hear

695
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,218
there is a child involved.

696
00:34:33,923 --> 00:34:36,858
Will you have her death
on your conscience, too?

697
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:39,794
How will you explain
that to her mother?

698
00:34:52,575 --> 00:34:54,676
<font color="#ff0000">♪</font>

699
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,395
You can see it, can't you?

700
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:16,631
You bottle your grief

701
00:35:16,632 --> 00:35:20,035
because you know how it will end.

702
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,037
You are guilty.

703
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,572
Always will be.

704
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:28,977
It is inevitable.

705
00:35:32,982 --> 00:35:35,517
You know what you have to do.

706
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:45,193
Good-bye, Father.

707

<font color="#ff0000">♪</font>

708
00:35:59,128 --> 00:36:00,595
He's over there.

709
00:36:00,596 --> 00:36:02,029
Oh, wow.

710
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:07,035
</font> That cannot be comfortable.

711
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:09,103
Wouldn't want to see
his dry cleaning bill.

712
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:12,173
Okay, remember I showed you
how to control the flow.

713
00:36:12,174 --> 00:36:13,441
Use the dials and keep

714
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:15,145
- a steady pressure...
- Alex, Alex, relax,

715
00:36:15,146 --> 00:36:15,977
I got it.

716
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,081
Oh, you got it.

717
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:22,417
Yeah... Uh, right.
Steady pressure. I got it.

718
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:23,751
Can you hurry up?

719
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:39,867
Whatever you're doing, do it faster.

720
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:41,135
Uh-huh.

721
00:36:44,673 --> 00:36:46,376
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

722
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:47,308
You sure?

723
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:49,043
- Easy.
- He's fast.

724
00:36:49,044 --> 00:36:50,311
Keep going.

725
00:36:50,312 --> 00:36:52,814
We'll go put this thing down.

726
00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:00,588
That's it.

727
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:02,390
The link should be broken.

728
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:04,926
: Okay. Okay...

729
00:37:30,252 --> 00:37:31,853
Move, you bastard.

730
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:38,926
Hey,

731
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:41,095

- Yeah.

Crane?

735
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,611

- I don't understand.

738
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:06,287
We just killed the thing
that had him captive.

739
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:08,471
U-Unless he's already too
far gone inside his own mind.

740
00:38:08,472 --> 00:38:09,991
Too far gone, what does that mean?

741
00:38:09,992 --> 00:38:12,760
</font> It means he's still
trapped inside the illusion.

742
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:38,052
So, what? There's no way to reach him?

743
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:39,487
</font> His soul is adrift.

744
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:41,689
He's lost his connection to our world.

745
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,591
He needs an anchor.

I need you to do something
for me, okay?

751
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:18,793
You know those... those drawings
in your sketchbook?

Yeah.

You know the man you drew, Mr. Crane?

What else can you tell me about him?

I think he's a nice man.

Kind.

00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:42,917
Funny.

But...

762
00:39:44,786 --> 00:39:47,021
he can also be sad.

<i>he's wrong.</i>

767
00:39:56,064 --> 00:39:57,965
He's got lots of friends.

768
00:39:57,966 --> 00:40:01,168
But he feels like he's let them down.

769

Even you, Mom.

770
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:08,242
But he hasn't.

He gives people something
they all need.

I guess we do.

796
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,676
You know, I got to say,

00:41:48,677 --> 00:41:51,512
this has been a night to remember.

798
00:41:51,513 --> 00:41:53,896

- Didn't you? I mean, how often

do you get to use tenth century
Chinese torches

to cut a man out of a despair
creature's psychic web, huh?

804
00:42:07,496 --> 00:42:09,230
Not often enough.

805
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:10,364
Exactly.

806
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:14,835
Look.

807
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:16,871
It's completely inert.

808
00:42:16,872 --> 00:42:18,305
No response to light.

809
00:42:18,306 --> 00:42:20,007
</font> Yeah. That makes sense.

810
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:24,078
The creature's dead, so is its webbing.

811
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,347
What are you gonna do with it?

812
00:42:26,348 --> 00:42:28,049
I should probably just dump it.

813
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:31,986
Yeah. Maybe tomorrow.

814
00:42:35,891 --> 00:42:39,694
So, how much would you have missed me?

815
00:42:39,695 --> 00:42:42,730
Like, on a scale of one to devastated.

have those torches, right?
